This repository contains the naive implementation of KNN and Multi-layer Perceptron (Neural Networks) from scratch. I'm working on the efficient implementation of these two algorithms and will be published in this repository: https://github.com/saisena-ss/Stanford---Computer-Vision-Implementation-from-Scratch
